Must/should be fixed before first release:

 X Start (enable) GUI first and output all critical error messages at start up to GUI.
 * Check/Fix CANCEL behavour (hang up before in call).
 * Add reject call functionality.
 * Correct behaviour when pressing the X button in the top right corner for all window.
 * "Embedded call dialogs" for the iPAQ (./configure argument).
 X Implement Re-register.
 * Do a proper shut down:
   - De-register from proxy
   - Remove semaphore
 * Fix presence information compatible with MSN messenger (SIP mode).
 * Separate threads for reading phone books (prevent hang while trying to download).
 * Multiple calls handled correctly:
   - local audio mixing
   - multiple sound sources
 * Implement recording/replaying of calls.
 X find a way to throw exceptions on iPAQ's
 X solve the crash when minisip is launched from an OPIE .desktop file
 * Decide on license, understand it and add it to each file.
 * Remove the possibility to call yourself.
 ? Number/SIP addr presentation
 X If a DNS SRV is not available, then "minisip" will seg. fault when 
   started on an IPAQ (probably exception not supported) - fix it.
 * Write manual page?
 * Create homepage
 * Create icon
 * Implement support for the sound card and network interface drop boxes in the settings dialog.
 X Check why we can not detect the SRV record for ssvl.kth.se and fix the bug
 * Investigate IPAQ frequency problem.
 * Ring in headphone when remote ringing
 X Integrate STUN
 * Enable editing of local phone books in the GUI.
 * move from linux primitive types to our own definitions (uint16_t -> own 
   def.) to make application more easily portable (Windows)
 * Use STUN to determine which local interface will most likely be used.  
 * Make RTP compile with big endian architectures.
 * Implement dis-continuous transmission of audio streams.

 * Fix branch parameter in ACK message. Now it is determined in
   SipMessageTransport - (bad design/solution)
 * Make timeout provider not have pointer to for example transaction - they
 	can be a dangling reference.
