--Video support in minisip--


minisip implements some experimental video support. The codec used
is H263, via ffmpeg's libavcodec.

To compile video support:

 . get ffmpeg's current CVS (see http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/download.php)

 . you need to apply a small patch to libavcodec, included in minisip:
        
	in ffmpeg's root directory:
	$ patch -p0 < minisip-libavcodec.patch
	
   This patch is used to detect when the end of a frame is contained in sent
   to the RTP callback. A more advanced patch will hopefully be integrated
   to ffmpeg.
   
 . compile it:
        $ ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-pp
	$ make
 
 . configure minisip with video support:
        $ ./configure --enable-video --with-ffmpeg=/path/to/ffmpeg/root
 
   If libsdl is installed on your system, it will be compiled as one video
   output. If your system has Xvideo, the xvideo video output
   will be compiled. If libdc1394 (firewire cameras) is present, the
   firewire camera input will be built.

 . compile minisip
       $ make
 
 . After having launched minisip once to create it, edit ~/.minisip.conf:
   <video_device> should be:
         /dev/video0 for example, if using v4l;
	 fw:0,0 if using the first camera on the first firewire bus.
  
   <frame_width> and <frame_height> are used to define the frame size you
   would like to *receive*. It can be 352x288 (CIF) or 176x144 (QCIF).
