README for ministun
===================

The 'ministun' package provides a standalone STUN server, based on the
reference implementation provided by Vovida; however, this package 
leverages the class libraries that are part of the minisip stack.

The STUN client continues to reside in libmnetutil, where it can be useful
for other applications.  The core STUN server has also been implemented in 
its own library, so it may be reused by the different front-end interfaces.
