============
Introduction
------------

This directory contains information pertaining to the strategic management
of the Minisip Project, primiarly organizational documents for understanding
and allocating the community's resources and milestone schedule.  

These documents create a form of 'meta-documentation' for the project, and 
they are not meant to be distributed outside of the project.  If anything, 
the information developed here should be distilled into a new form for 
presentation to the general public.  More generally, project coordinators
need these documents to make security, stability, or other decisions.

Still, the processes have been designed to be open and transparent, so this 
is not an attempt to obfuscate our governance.  It just acknowledges that 
these documents should seek brevity to ensure comleteness and accuracy; 
their function is much like notes passed between developers on a series of
shared whiteboards.  Each milestone document should iterate our succinct
snapshots of microcosmic progress, each of which then requires a thousand 
words for the average user to grok.

================
New Contributors
----------------

If you are new to this project, you should read 'bootstrap.txt' - after
you have taken the time to read the following documents.  That file 
assumes you are familiar with most of the information found in this tree.
