Overview
--------

This document provides an overview for the policies and procedures that
contributors to this project are expected to follow.

=============
Mailing Lists
-------------

Active contributors must participate on the mailing lists:

  * (Re-)subscribe and introduce yourself before making your first commit.

  * Read and follow the mailing list on a weekly basis if active.

  * Provide a warning before making drastic changes to the trunk.

  * Answer questions about your changes from active contributors; replies
    citing problems may not be ignored.

  * Respond to other inqueries requesting feedback from all contributors;
    a simple "ack" or "nack" can provide vital feedback (and it's polite).

  * Participate in stratigic development decision making processes.

=====================
SVN Repository Access
---------------------

Write access to the project repositories is a privilege; the authority
granted by such access requires that contributors hold themselves fully
responsibile for any contributors they make.  This responsibility is to 
the community, who individually or collectively can hold contributors 
accountable for problems with their contributions.  Repeated failures in
this process will result in the loss of this privilege.

Contributors must be willing to address any problems introduced by their 
changes; in other words, they must hold themselves accountable for their 
responsibility to protect the community's assets.  If this seems like too
much to bear, they should not be allowed write access to the repository.  
Instead, their contributions should pass through a responsible party; the 
individual that commits the changes will be held accountable for
supporting them.

================
Patch Guidelines
----------------

All patches and commits should obey the following rules:

  * There should only be one logical change; multiple changes should
    be split into a series of patches.
    
    * Reviewers must be able to assess the correctness of a patch.

    * Possible stability or security implications are easy to see.
  
    * Superfluous changes (e.g. "fixing" whitespace) should be avoided.

  * Every change must be accompanied by a descriptive log message. 

    * In general, each change should be describable in 80 characters;
      otherwise, you are probably trying to make more than one change.

  * Patches posted to the mailing list for consderation should be made
    using 'diff -auRn' to produce suitable contextual output.
