Overview
--------

This document attempts to provide a guide to working with the milestone
system.  You should already be familiar with the other documents listed
in the README file in this directory.  If you have not read those files, 
you should probably go read them now.

==================================
How to Participate In This Project
----------------------------------

Once you are familiar with the existing processes, the following abstract
directions will ensure you are integrated into the project in the most 
efficient manner possible.  The concrete goal of these instructions will 
be to construct a minimal series of SVN commits, incorporating the 
necessary information in the proper places.

To become an active contributor, you need to do the following things 
according to the prescribed procceses:

0) Subscribe to the mailing lists; introduce yourself to the community. 
   See 'policies.txt' for more information about this requirement.

1) Add your own 'contributor' directory (using uppercase initials), with
   your e-mail/sip contact information.  Add your personal roadmap, if
   it does not fit into the upcoming project milestone path.

2) For those projects in which you intend to participate, add your name,
   initials, and intentions in the proper part of the 'people.txt' file.

3) Add your wish list to the "unsorted" milestone, add your ongoing and
   long-term work to the "assigned" milestone.  Do not list parts of the
   system which have limited audience (i.e. tasks on your commercial 
   roadmap), as you should have listed these in step #1.

At this point, you should probably commit your changes to the repository, 
or send a patch to the -devel list to get someone's attention.  Once you
have this information in the repository, you can proceed with your work
or follow-up planning:

1) If you have immediate work that is about to be completed, contact the 
   most appropriate working group coordinator to see when it may be included.

2) While you are working
