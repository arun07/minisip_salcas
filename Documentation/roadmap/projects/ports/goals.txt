============
Introduction
------------

This document presents the long-term goals for the Ports Working Group.
These serve to guide the group on a clear path for fulfilling the group'
s specific functions within The Project.

===========
Group Goals
-----------

1) "We want to be platform agnostic, relatively speaking."
  a) All libraries and applications will be ported to every platform.
  b) All platforms should be treated equally by other WG, relative to
     the amount of Porting resources available.

2) "We want to keep the platforms out of the programs." 
  a) All abstract interfaces must have a fully portable implementation, 
     except where all implementations must be native (e.g. sound drivers).
  b) Portability allows selecting an alternate, native implementation.
  c) Native implementations should work together to maximize common 
     portability code in their abstraction layer.

3) "Portable is beautiful, except when it isn't"
  a) Portability occurs at the implementation level (e.g. source files).
  b) Interfaces (e.g. header files) should never contain portability code.
  c) This aims to avoid "#ifdef hell" in our public API headers.
