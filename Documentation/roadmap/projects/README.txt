============
Introduction
------------

To ensure that critical responsibilities are being actively completed, 
The Minisip Project structures its activities into several working groups.  

==============
Working Groups
--------------

The following Working Groups have been established in order to carry out 
an individual goal of The Project:

 * Minisip Stack - The reusable components (primarily LGPL licensed).
 * Minisip Apps - The top-level components (primarily GPL licensed).
 * Minisip Build - Build, Test, Package, and Release (BTPR) work.
 * Minisip Ports - Linux, Windows, MacOS distribution/platform support.
 * Minisip Sites - The website, mailing lists, and other IT resources.
 * Minisip Docs - Handle documentation for all of the above groups.
 * Minisip I18N - Handle translations for all of the above groups.

Each of these groups provide additional information, as outlined below.
In addition, each may define their own working groups; for example,
the Stack group may choose to create both "sound" and "video" groups,
in order to enable others to manage these large parts of the system.

==============
Joining Groups
--------------

Contributors may choose to participate in many or all of these groups; 
however, the decision-making roles must be filled by approved individuals,
in order to provide an healthy blend of perspectives and motivations. More
directly, the community will not follow leaders that they do not respect,
so the approval process simply connotes earning community's respect.

The process for joining is up to each working group; if their requirements
are not clear, be sure to ask the group leader.  Generally, contributors
are welcome to join anything at any time.  The more the merrier! :)

=================
Group Coordinator
-----------------

As with most open projcets, most decisions about what to work on are 
made by the contributors themselves.  Our coordinators authority derives
from their experience and knowledge; when conflicts arise, others should 
respect their demonstrated ability to make good decisions and follow them
without (prolonged) questioning.

When their decisions clearly seek to serve the entire community, all 
contributors will be expected to respect our group coordinators.

=============
Project Files
-------------

Each working group provide several organization documents:

 <project>/
 	README.txt		- A high-level summary of the working group
	goals.txt		- A detailed summary of working group goals.
	process.txt		- All working group policies and procedures.

Each working group may choose to provide additional information specific
to their chartered mission.
