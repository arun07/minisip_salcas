============
Introduction
------------

This document presents the long-term goals for the Docs Working Group.
These serve to guide the group on a clear path for fulfilling the group's 
specific functions within The Project.

===========
Group Goals
-----------

1) "A system is only as useful as its documentation allows it to be."
  a) Developers require current API documentation.
  b) Users require current tutorials, use cases, and feature guides.
  c) Other Minisip Working Groups produce and consume internal documents.

2) "Multiple formats serve the needs of multiple people."
  a) In general, all documents must be line-based, text files.
  b) In general, all documents must be transmutable into other formats.

3) "The system is not complete until the documentation is complete."
  a) Releases may be delayed if critical documents are missing.
  b) Distribution installations should include user documentation.
