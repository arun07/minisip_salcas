============
Introduction
------------

This document presents the long-term goals for the Application Working Group.
These serve to guide the group on a clear path to deliver the best possible
applications and interfaces that work on a wide variety of platforms.

===========
Group Goals
-----------

1) "Many users require many interfaces."
  a) The Working Group consumes the Minisip Library Stack APIs.
  b) Individual WG contributors merge these APIs with different interfaces,
     including GTK+, QT, and ncurses.
  c) Each application interface may opt to include or omit functionality
     provided by the Stack or UI libraries.
  d) All of the above require this WG coordinate these disparate needs, 
     ensuring that re-usable portions of applications and their interfaces
     are shared to whatever extent is possible.

2) "No interface deserves to be ignored."
  a) If an application has a maintainer, it must be maintained.
  b) Every application must pass its distribution tests to be released,
     so all maintainers should work together to ensure their work is not
     held up by any other interface.
  c) All WG members must agree to milestone goals for each application; 
     the maintainer may provide their desired list, but others must agree
     that all goals can be accomplished (to avoid defaults under (b)).

3) "Make it work first, make it correct next, make it pretty last."
  a) Supporting functionality matters, but correctness matters more.
  b) Correctness must exist before spending significant resources on the
     appearance of the application; except,
  c) An application's appearance needs to be improved if it hurts usability;
     correctness has not been acheive if the existing layout is not usable.
