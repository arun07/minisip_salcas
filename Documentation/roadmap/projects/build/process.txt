How to Add a Configure Option
-----------------------------

Technical details aside, the process of adding a new configurable option
has consequences in many different groups; the Build Group works to ensure
that all of the necessary details have been completed.

1) Implement the configure option in the system, if not done already.
  a) Add it to the appropriate configure.ac
  b) Add it to build.conf for the relevant project

2) Ensure the Docs group makes or reviews the new option.  This includes:
  a) Developer documentation (in /Documentation/build/)
  b) new user documentation on the web site(....)

3) Ensure the Ports group recognizes the existance, disapperance, or other
   change to the option; this may require they update their packaging files.

4) Ensure the Sites group recognizes the need to update the build docs.
