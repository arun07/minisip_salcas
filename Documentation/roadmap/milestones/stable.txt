Overview
--------

This document provides an overview of the stable milestone release process.
The policies and procedures described herein should be used by all project
working groups to ensure each release meets our standards for quality.

==========
Definition
----------

Our "stable milestones" serve to provide limited security and bug fixes 
to a tested and verified version of our software.  These changes should
never break API/ABI compatibility or add new features.

Some users must necessarily plan to install a given version for extended
periods of time, as they can not risk a new version introducing problems
at their installation.

The stable branch also allows the project to continue to attract the
attention of new users and developers in the times between new feature
realeases.

=======
Process
-------

The following steps should be taken to produce a stable milestone release:

1) The production of stable milestones relies on the BTPR WG to coordinate 
   all of the other activities into a focused stablization effort.

2) All of the milestone tasks waiting to be accomplished must be addressed
   or moved to a future milestone.

3) A complete audit of all task must then be performed, which will
   identify additional tasks that were overlooked until now.

4) Once the audit tasks have been completed, the BTPR coordinator will: 
  a) tag the repo
  b) package the release tarballs with 'make distcheck',
  c) notify the Ports group to finalize each platform's packages
  d) notify the Docs group to finalize all release materials
  e) notify the Sites group to prepare to be Dugg, Slashdotted, etc.

5) Upon production of stable tarballs: 
  a) the Ports group will finalize, tag, package, and release each 
     platform's distribution packages.
  b) the Docs group will finalize all materials generated from these, 
     including the output from Doxygen, packaged README information,
     press release, and other static deliverables.
  c) the Sites group will post the tarballs, platform packages, and
     documentation as they become available.
