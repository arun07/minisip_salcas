Overview
--------

If you are *not* willing to be responsible for ensuring that a task or goal 
is completed to the satisfaction of the community, place it here for others
to find and adopt as their own cause.  Be sure that your task has not 
already been "assigned" or included in one of our upcoming milestones.

Read the Milestone Process Guide for information about how to add tasks to 
these lists.

Unsorted Tasks
