Overview
--------

The v0.7.5 and v0.8 releases seek to bootstrap a solid release process,
providing the first publicly packaged versions of the project of 2006.
The focus should be on stablizing the existing code, working out details 
of our new release processes, with the goal of recruiting new developers
and other contributors.  A new release means fresh PR and other material
can be used to attract other resources to use for subsequent milestones.
