Overview
--------

This document provides the processes for updating the project's milestones,
including the following common tasks:

 * How to Add New Unsorted Tasks
 * How to Adopt Unsorted Tasks
 * How to Add New Assigned Tasks
 * How to Add New Milestone Tasks

================
Active Milestone
----------------

Several "active" milestones are maintained, corresponding to upcoming 
releases of the software deliverables.  These primarily serve to collect 
sets of tasks into a single location, to ensure all project members are 
working off of the same set of governing documents.

In addition to these active milestones, two additional meta-milestones 
exist for stratigic task management: "unsorted" and "assigned".  First,
our unsorted tasks have not been actively adopted by community members;
conversely, the assigned milestone tracks tasks that have active members 
working to complete them.  

In both cases, these tasks serve to provide the raw material for creating 
future milestones; in other words, they are not be expected to be finished 
until *after* the currently active milestones have been reached.  As each
milestone has been compelted, it becomes "inactive"; simultaneously, the 
next planned milestone should be made active, which may simply involve
moving tasks from the unsorted and assigned lists.


=============================
How to Add New Unsorted Tasks
-----------------------------

If you *are* willing to be responsible for the tasks you have in mind, you
should consider adding them as "assigned".

To add a new "unsorted" task:

 1) Determine where your task should be located (so, no, not truly random).

 2) Add your name (and, optionally, email) to the appropriate file header.

 3) Add the follow details in a couple of sentences.
  a) A brief statement of the problem, and/or
  b) The desired solution, if known.

If you want to be contacted when someone adopts a task you have added here 
(or was already present), then you should also perform these steps:

 4) Be sure you provided your email address in the header (and keep it fresh).

 5) Add your initials to those tasks


===========================
How to Adopt Unsorted Tasks
---------------------------

If you decide to complete a task that is on this list, you should do the 
following things:

 1) Contact the person that put it here (if listed); also, post to -devel.

 2) Determine how long it will take you to finish, and figure out which 
    milestone will be most likely be able to include it.

 3) If the task will not be ready for the next feature release, you may 
    simply want to move the task to the 'assigned' milestone to claim it;
    follow the process below to do this.

 4) If it will be done before the next feature release, contact the 
    milestone coordinator about your intentions; preferably, you should 
    initiate this dialogue in the -devel mailing list (for transparency).

 5) If they approve, move the task into the appropriate milestone.

 6) Do not be surprised if they first want to see a working implementation.


=============================
How to Add New Assigned Tasks
-----------------------------

If you believe a task should be included in one of our active milestones; 
you should contact its release coordinator.  Tasks should only be "assigned" 
in order to track work that does not have a known completion date; immediate 
and short-term work should be worked directly into our milestone schedule.

To add a new "assigned" task, the process is very similar to adding new
"unsorted" tasks; however, optional contact information is now required:

 1) Determine where your task should be located in the heirarchy.

 2) Add your name and email to the appropriate file header.

 3) Add the follow details in a couple of sentences.
  a) A brief statement of the problem, and/or
  b) The desired solution, if known.
 
 4) You must provided your email address in the header (and keep it fresh).

 5) Add your initials to the new task; you may also add your initials
    to other tasks if you are actively working on them as well.

==============================
How to Add New Milestone Tasks
------------------------------

The release coordinator establishes all milestone task lists, using the
input of active contributors and project management.  In order to have
your tasks added to a milestone, you *must* coordinate your activity with
that individual before proceeding with the steps in this section.

To add a new milestone task, the process is very similar to adding a new
"assigned" tasks; however, additional information must be tracked:

0) Be sure you have permission from the appropriate milestone coordinator!

2) Follow steps 1-5 in "How to Add New Assigned Tasks", above.

3) You will be required to demonstrate that your task was completed and 
   meets expected quality; at the very minimum, the following information
   should be annotated for each milestone task:

   a) A list of relevant revisions that consitute the bulk of the changes.
   b) The name of the test program that covers the changes or new features.
   c) Any new libraries, code modules, configure options, environment 
      variables and other implementation details; only searchable keywords 
      need to be included.
   
4) Depending on the nature and scope of the work, you may be required to 
   include the following information:

   a) The name, email, and intials of an independent auditing developer.
   b) Additional end-user documentation or other support resources.
