Overview
--------

If you are willing to be responsible for ensuring that a task or goal will
be completed to the satisfaction of the community, place it here for others
to recognize as an "in progress" activity.  This ensures recognition that 
you are actively working on a problem and intend to deliver a solution at 
some distant or unspecified point in the future.

If you are not willing to take responsibility for completing a task, do 
*not* list it here as "assigned"; instead, add it to our "unsorted" goals 
so others may adopt it.

By adding a task to an active milestone document, you acknowledge and 
accept that you will be held responsible for completing the required 
work in the time frame specified in the document.  Further, you will 
be personally accountable to the coordinators(s) listed in that document;
this seeks to ensure both the quality and timliness of all contributors.


In either case, see the 'process.txt' file for information about how to add
tasks to these lists.

Assigned Tasks
--------------

The tasks listed herein are not meant to be listed in any particular
priority, rather they have been grouped according to the project group 
most likely to complete them.
