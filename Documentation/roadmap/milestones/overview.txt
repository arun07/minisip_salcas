===========
The Prelude
-----------

0) We all want the following milestones:
  a) We want to see an fairly immediate 0.8 release.
  b) We want to reach 1.0 on Jan 1, 2007.
  c) We want imagine that 2.0 will be on track for 2009 or 2010.

========
The Plan
--------

1) "Our plans are only that; still, we should all work together."

  a) The existance of plans do not consitute a contract or assurance 
     that community members intend to accomplish any of the outlined 
     work in the time projected, nor intend to limit or direct the 
     activities or contributions sought by the project.

  b) Notwithstanding (a), contributing community members will recognize:

    i) such plans represent governing articles of all project activities; 
     that means contributors will be expected to comply with any plans 
     formally adopted by the group.

    ii) All plans are subject to ratification by voting members of the 
        community and may be changed only after appropriate mob rule.

    iii) A roadmap should exist for at least two upcoming stable releases,
         or new managment should be sought.

  c) We reserve the right to change our plans at any time; these changes
     will be made to increase quality, reallocate resources, or simply
     to ammuse ourselves.

2) "Once we reach 1.0, we want regular, tested, ABI-compatible stability
   releases along every x.y branch; feature releases that break the ABI 
   should occur less frequently."

  a) Like the kernel, x.{odd}.z will be testing releases,
         and releases x.{even}.z will be stable releases.

  b) Feature releases will bump y, once every three or four months.

  c) Stability releases will bump z, once a month.

  d) Security releases will be identified by 4 digit version (x.y.z.N);
     these will be released as fast as they can be tested and packaged.

3) "We want monthly stable releases, and security fixes in 24 hours."

  a) We have (or rather, need to have identified) vulnerabilities, and
     we need a consistent process that will be used to produce releases
     in a timely manner.  The stable release is a monthly "fire drill".

  b) Distribution maintainers want to provide regular package releases, 
     particularly in light of (a).  A monthly release is good practice.

  c) freshmeat.net and other resources allow good exposure to a wide
     variety of potential contributors and users.

4) "We want quartery feature releases; keep the innovation coming!"

  a) We must continue to have the ability to create new technology.

  b) New, previously experimental features should only be exposed to 
     the average user once they have been adequately documented and
     the community has been prepared to field problems from the masses.

  c) Quarterly press-releases can provide exposure to the enterprise,
     provide opportunities for "flash and bang" at tradeshows, and 
     create other ephemeral positive value.

5) "The release tools should provide the opportunity for vendors to 
   choose to integrate fixes, package, and maintained past versions."

  a) We will support only the 'trunk' and 'last' branches.

  b) Three or four times per year, the 'last' tree will be archived.

  c) The current 'trunk' will be copied to become the new 'last' tree, 
     corresponding to the new minor stable release of the trunk.

  d) The new 'trunk' will be re-opened for minor/major development.

  e) For example, we would release fixes 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc. monthly
     until 1.2 (and the last 1.0.x) has been stablized.  We then produce 
     fixes 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and vendors would have to produce 1.0.{x+n} on
     their own (or through the hereby foretold "minisip-legacy" list).

===========
The Details
-----------

1) Our periodic public drop will occur on the first Wednesday of each 
   month; however, that rule will not be held fast.
