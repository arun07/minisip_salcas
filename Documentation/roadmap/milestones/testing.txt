========
Overview
--------

This document provides an overview of the testing milestone release process.
The policies and procedures described herein should be used by all project
working groups to ensure each release meets our standards for quality.

==========
Definition
----------

Our "testing milestones" represent releases produced for the sake of 
learning about new, experimental additions to the software.  Stability 
and other quality metrics do not matter as much, as the distribution of 
these releases should be limited to contributors.

=========
Processes
---------

The production of testing milestones should accompany the normal stable
release process, if sufficient development has occured to warrent such.

More information will be added as it becomes available.
