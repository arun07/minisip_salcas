Overview
--------

For each milestone, additional directories are created to plan the 
project's goals for each successive release.  Each milestone directory 
thus serves as a reminder of our successes (or failures) of reaching 
our planned goals.  With these results, we can tune our future milestone 
goals to ensure we always deliver everything that we promise.


===============
Meta-Milestones
---------------

To enable developers to work on things that do not fit into our next 
upcoming releases, additional meta-milestones will coordinate work taking 
place outside of the release process.  At present, these include the 
"unsorted" and "assigned" milestones; each contain focused descriptions
of their purpose, and the 'process.txt' document provides instructions
for updating them correctly.


=====================
Unofficial Milestones
---------------------

The milestones contained in the main directory pertain to the ongoing 
release process; even our meta-milestones seek to provide staging areas 
for future official releases.  To enable contributors to organize and plan
the activities for accomplishing their own mission and goals for minisip, 
other "unofficial" milestones may be developed in other locations.

------------------------
Working Group Milestones
........................

Each project working group may provide its own milestones under the 
'projects' tree. The guidelines for adding or updating new project 
milestones may be different for each project; unless otherwise specified, 
contributors will be expected to follow the policies and procedures 
outlined in the main 'projects/process.txt' document.

----------------------
Contributor Milestones
......................

Similarly, each contributor may populate their own private milestone 
directory with their goals and roadmap; this provides a place to develop 
roadmaps for "highly vertical" projects or tasks.  As long as the result 
will bring value to the minisip project community, we encourage every
contributor to share their innovative and detailed suggestions.
