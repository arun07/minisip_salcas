Mission Statement
-----------------

The Minisip Project (The Project) seeks to provide the highest quality 
Free and Open Source internet collaboration technologies by continuing 
the development, production, and maintenance of the minisip software 
stack, applications, and surrounding infrastructure.

======================
Mission Working Groups
----------------------

That relatively dense statement breaks out into a number of areas of 
ongoing activity, which can be summarized in a number of deliverables
that are produced by associated "working groups": Stack and Libraries,
Applications, Build/Test/Package/Release, Per-Platform Packaging and 
Porting, On-line Services, and - everyone's favorite - Documentation.

Participants in The Project should recognize the important role that 
each plays in the successful release of a software product. As such,
this structure should be been reflected in our ongoing task analysis 
and resource allocation decisions.

The 'projects' directory contains documents describing these groups in 
further detail, along with milestone-agnostic process documentation.

==================
Mission Milestones
------------------

Given the considerable requirements of the average end-user, these groups 
must work closely together to deliver new releases on a regular schedule.  
In order to acheive consistently high quality releases, we should attempt
to make measurable performance improvements in each these areas.

To achieve these results, a regular milestone release process has been
implemented.  The 'milestones' directory holds additional documents 
which contain explanations of how the process should work.  Each active 
contributor is encouraged to maintain their own individual roadmaps, 
which can be found in the 'contributors' directory.

=================
Minisip Customers
-----------------

The Project activities are managed with the purpose of serving those 
individuals, organizations, and agencies that have contributed to it.
While the governing mission and goals seek to provide a generally useful
platform, the practical day-to-day decisions will be determined by the
participants who choose (or are paid) to be involved in some capacity.

In order to ensure the daily activities remain on-track, participants
must acknowledge a certain level of responsibility to The Project goals. 
To foster this feeling, each contributor to minisip should treat every 
other as if they were their customer.  This is not far from the truth; 
their contribution has created new value for everyone who uses the system.

In this capacity, the following general classes of groups deserve to be
recognized as your customers:

1) Users that report bug reports, provide test case feedback, or otherwise
   _proactively_ get involved with the project.

2) Developers that write code, documentation, web pages, unit tests, or 
   provide similar deliverables for the project.

3) Benefactors that donate money, equipment, hosting, bandwidth, or other
   goods and services to the project.

In general, those are our customers; this breakout does not correlate to 
influence.   In that capacity, our participants' earn the mutual respect 
required to come to agreeable compromises that benefit everyone.
