/**
 * This class defines the user callback functions supported by ZRTP.
 *
 * This class is a pure abstract class, aka Interface in Java, that specifies
 * the user callback interface for the ZRTP implementation. The ZRTP
 * implementation uses these functions to communicate with a user interface
 * environment, for example to inform about security state, display messages,
 * and so on.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * This ZRTP interface defines five abstract callback methods to be
 * implemented by the user interface environment.
 *
 * This class also defines standard methods to interact with the ZrtpQueue
 * to control ZRTP behaviour.
 *
 * The destructor does not destroy any objects, it only sets pointers to
 * referenced classes to <ode>NULL</code>.
